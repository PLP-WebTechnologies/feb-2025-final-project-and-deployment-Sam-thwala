      <h1>All About Medical Laboratory Science</h1>
      <p>Medical Laboratory Science (MLS) is a field that studies the analysis of human fluids, tissues, and cells to aid in the diagnosis and treatment of diseases. Medical Laboratory Scientists, also known as Medical Technologists, play a vital role in healthcare by providing crucial information to doctors about a patient's health.</p>

      <p>Being a Medical Laboratory Scientist is my dream. I discovered the career last year and I was hooked. I think Medical Laboratory Scientists are the back-bones of health, they are the reason why your doctor is able to diagnose your illness. When I study the course I'll specialize in Clinical Pathology. Clinical Pathology is a combination of Chemical Pathology, Haematology and Microbiology.</p>
      <blockquote>Medical lab scientists are called the Oracle of modern medicine because we might not be seen by patients daily in most health facilities but they play a vital role in the diagnosis of diseases and patients' recovery.</blockquote>
      <p>In South Africa Med lab is offered as a 4 years Honours degree (NQF level 8), Bachelor of Health Sciences in Medical Laboratory Sciences. It is offered in the following universities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Durban University of Technology.</li>
        <li>University of Johannesburg.</li>
        <li>Tshwane University of Technology.</li>
        <li>Cape Peninsula University of Technology.</li>
        <li>Nelson Mandela University.</li>
        <li>Mangosuthu University of Technology.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>PathCare also offers a Student Medical Laboratory Technician (SMLT) programme which is a two-year programme in which suitable candidates are recruited to undergo training to become Medical Laboratory Technicians. You can use this programme as a stepping stone. If you want more information you can research.</p>
