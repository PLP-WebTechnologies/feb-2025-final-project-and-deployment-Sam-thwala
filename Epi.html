      <h1>All About Epidemiology</h1>
      <p>Epidemiology is the study of the distribution, patterns, and determinants of health and disease conditions in a defined population. It also involves applying this knowledge to prevent diseases and improve public health. Essentially, epidemiology examines why some people are more susceptible to certain diseases than others, and how these diseases spread through populations.</p>

      <p>I discovered Epidemiology in my second year of university. I had it as a year module and I was instantly interested. I wanted to know more about it so I did my research and fell more in love with it.</p>
      <blockquote>“Epidemiology is in large part a collection of methods for finding things out on the basis of scant evidence, and this by its nature is difficult.”-Alex Broadbent</blockquote>
      <p>Epidemiology is offered as a Masters program in South Africa, which means you have to have a NQF level 8 degree (Honours degree). Only students who come from a range of disciplinary backgrounds including medical, microbiology, dentistry, statistics, computer science, veterinary science, demography, Nutrition, Psychology or any other health related degree are eligible for the program. Epidemiology is offered in the following universities in South Africa: </p>
      <ul>
        <li>University of Cape Town (UCT): Offers a Master of Science (MSc) in Epidemiology and Biostatistics, as well as a Master of Public Health (MPH) program with an emphasis on epidemiology</li>
        <li>University of the Witwatersrand (Wits): Provides an MSc in Epidemiology. </li>
        <li>University of Pretoria (UP): Offers an MSc in Epidemiology, with a focus on applied epidemiology within the context of the FETP</li>
        <li>Stellenbosch University: Offers a Masters program in Clinical Epidemiology.</li>
        <li>University of Fort Hare: Offers a Doctor of Philosophy (PhD) in Epidemiology.</li>
        <li>University of KwaZulu-Natal: Offers the School of Nursing and Public Health.</li>
        <li>Sefako Makgatho Health Sciences University: Has a department of Epidemiology and Biostatistics.</li>
        <li>South African Field Epidemiology Training Programme (FETP): A residency program, in collaboration with the NICD, leading to an MSc in Field Epidemiology from either UP or Wits. </li>
      </ul>
      <p>I am planning to pursue Epidemiology as a career and I think its a rewarding career plus it has a very good salary. If you want to learn more about Epidemiology, you can do more research.</p>
