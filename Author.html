      <p>I have a talent for writing. My love for writing started when I was young, my dad would buy me books to read and I would get motivated to write my own. So I did, my first book was a kids story. I would make a book using paper and paper glue. As I grew older my writings became a way to express myself but I never edit or proof-read my stories so they all became drafts.</p>

      <button class="accordion-header">FORSAKEN</button>
      <div class="accordion-content"><em>The clicking of heels was heard as a women dressed so elegantly walked into the once silent church. She wore red bottom heels. Her melanin skin shined brightly, highlighting her beauty. She walked with elegance. She was the symbol of perfection which is why no one would have guessed that she had a storm inside her. Her heart was heavy, filled with sorrow and pain. Maybe if someone had knew of her pain they would have saved her. She walked down the aisle until she reached the sculpture of an angel. It was so beautiful, it reminded her of purity. Something so beautiful and pure. In a way it resembled her. They were both perfect, so undeniably beautiful but only one them was pure. After all her purity was taken away from her. Her perfect façade crumbled in a blink of an eye. She collapsed on the cold hard floor. Her body shaking with uncontrollable sobs. Everything she was holding inside, all the pain, the sorrow, the regrets was finally released. She had hoped to feel relieved after letting everything out instead she felt dread. She was angry. She didn’t deserve this. She tried her best to be the best version of herself. She never worried or bullied anyone so why was she being punished. Why do good people have to suffer? She has suffered in the hands of other people so why was she being punished? Doesn’t karma exist? What about God? A scream filled with anger left her lips. She didn’t deserve this. At that moment she realized the painful truth. It was a hard pill to swallow. She really has been forsaken. All her prayers were unanswered. Maybe she did deserve this. No. She didn’t. She had tried her best. It may not have been enough but it was her best nonetheless. She cried until she lost consciousness. What she didn’t know was that the angel whose feet she cried on, was crying with her. The once angelic face of the scripture was now sad. God had been listening to her cries but he couldn’t interfere for this unfortunately was her destiny. Not everyone will have a happy ending and she was one of the unfortunate souls who are doomed to experience suffering until their very last breath. So in a way she was forsaken. </em></div>

      <button class="accordion-header">ARE YOU HAPPY WITH YOURSELF? (Inspired by Pretty Hurts by Beyoncé)</button>
      <div class="accordion-content"><em> She stared at her reflection, her face decorated with a plastic smile. She was getting ready to go on a date with her husband. She had work done on her body. Her whole body was completely modified. She couldn’t even recognize herself. All of this was for him. He told her he hated her brunette hair so she dyed it blond. Next he told her to get a breast reduction, he couldn’t stand her sagging breast. As years past, she became more plastic. He wanted her to be his doll. The perfect trophy wife. She cried herself to sleep every night. Why wasn’t he satisfied? She lost part of herself with every surgery. A tear fell down her eyes, she quickly wiped it off. She had to be perfect or he won’t be happy. Her only purpose is to make him happy. She lives for him. “Is it all worth it? The pain, the surgeries, your misery. Is it all worth it?” they always asked her. Her answer is always the same. Yes it was worth it because he was the only family she has. If he left who will love her? How will she survive without him? He loves her so she will do her best to satisfy him and make him happy. ‘Are you happy with yourself?’ No but this is what he wants so she will remain unhappy just to please him. She added the last touches to her makeup. “ Are you done?” he called by the door. “Yes dear.” She answered. With her plastic smile still on her face she walked up to him. Her hips swaying seductively. He held her waist with possessiveness. She belonged in his arms. His perfect doll. With a kiss to his cheek, they left for their dinner date.  </em></div>

      <button class="accordion-header">SONNET 130 (Inspired by Sonnet 130)</button>
      <div class="accordion-content"><em>    ‘My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun.’ He never thought he would witness a Shakespeare poem with his own eyes. Under a willow tree stood a man and a woman. Both young and full of life. When he was approached by his crush he would have never imagined that she would utter such words with no emotion. “Be my lover.” She said. He stood speechless staring into her dull eyes. Her face void of emotions. Were her eyes always this dull? Even with the sun reflecting against them they never once shined. Mostly importantly, who confesses their love with such a flat voice? It’s like she is demanding him to be hers. Who would have thought she was dominant. With a petite body like hers, one would mistake her for a submissive woman. ‘If hairs be wires, black wires grow on her head.’ The longer he stared at her, the more she resembles Medusa. Instead of wires, her hair resembles serpents. She might as well be Medusa since he has frozen from shock. Her expression changed from emotionless to vexed the longer he stayed silent. What she didn’t realized is that he has always loved her. So his answer will not disappoint her. After regaining his composure he opened his mouth to accept her request. He was after all hopelessly in love with her. ‘My mistress’ eyes are nothing like the sun.’ She may have dull eyes. ‘I love to hear her speak, yet well I know That music hath a far more pleasing sound’  And her voice may be flat. ‘And yet, by heaven, I think my love as rare. As any she belied with false compare.’  For she is the one his heart beats for.  </em></div>
