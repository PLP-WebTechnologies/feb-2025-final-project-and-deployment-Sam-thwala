      <h1>All About Homeopathy</h1>
      <p>Homeopathy is a therapeutic medical system, which is based on the observation that substances that are capable of causing diseases of the mind or body in healthy people can be used in the dilute form as remedies to treat the similar disorder in someone who is ill.</p>

      <p>Homeopathy is the course I am studying. It's a very interesting career and it is not known. Also many people doubt it but it does work, I've seen proof. I believe that Homeopathy is the safe way to heal people without experiencing side effects. I highly recommend that people visit a Homeopath at least once a year.</p>
      <blockquote>“Let Likes be Cured by Likes"-Derived from the Greek words homoios, meaning like, and pathos, meaning suffering.</blockquote>
      <p>Homeopathic training in South Africa involves a five year full-time degree (MHSc in Homeopathy at DUT or BHSc CM at UJ). Registration with the Allied Health Professions Council of South Africa (AHPCSA) is a statutory requirement and graduates become eligible for registration upon completion of their academic and statutory requirements. It is only offered in 2 universities:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>Durban University of Technology.</li>
        <li>University of Johannesburg.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>I may not want to pursue Homeopathy as a career due to personal reasons but I do believe in it. I hope that with this people will find it interesting enough to expand it.</p>
