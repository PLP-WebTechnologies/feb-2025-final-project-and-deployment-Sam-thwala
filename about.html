        <h2>All About Sam</h2>
        <p>
          Hello, or as I say in my native language, Sawubona. My name is Samukelisiwe Siphesihle Thwala, a 22 year old curious woman. Who has an interest in a lot of careers but mainly health science, IT and writing stories. 
        </p>
        <p>
         In this blog I will be sharing my knowledge on these careers and why I love them but first I will share a little more information about me.
        </p>
        <p>
          My full name means "We welcome this beautiful gift" in Zulu, which makes sense because I am a beautiful gift. I'm a South African from the Zulu and Swati tribes.
        </p>
        <p>
        My hobbies include reading, writing, listening to music, watching anime and playing mind challenging games. I am quite introverted.  
        </p>
        <p>
          I am a firm believer in the power of education and self-improvement. I am always looking for ways to better myself and my skills, and I encourage others to do the same. I believe that we can all make a difference in the world, no matter how small.
        </p>
        <p>
          I am excited to share my journey with you and hope that you will join me on this adventure. Together, we can learn, grow, and make a positive impact in the world. Thank you for visiting my blog, and I look forward to connecting with you!
