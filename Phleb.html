      <h1>All About Phlebotomy</h1>
      <p>Phlebotomy is the process of drawing blood, typically for diagnostic tests or blood donation, usually performed by phlebotomists, nurses, or technicians. The procedure, known as venipuncture, involves puncturing a vein, often in the arm, with a needle to collect blood.</p>

      <p>I learnt about Phlebotomy last year, through my dad. I am not really interested in it but I do think that its interesting. You can use it as a stepping stone to get into nursing school. There is not much information about Phlebotomy in South Africa, its a very hidden career so I do believe that there is a good amount of job opportunities.</p>
      <blockquote>Fun Fact: Phlebotomists are nicknamed as the vampires of health.</blockquote>
      <p>As I said there is not much information about Phlebotomy in South Africa, so it is only offered in a few organisations as learnerships.</p>
      <ul>
        <li>PathCare Academy: Offers a two-year learnership (Further Education and Training Certificate: Phlebotomy Techniques, NQF level 4) that combines theoretical learning with practical work experience</li>
        <li>SAQA (South African Qualifications Authority): Provides information on the Phlebotomy Certificate Program, which is a part-time, two-semester program.</li>
        <li>Ampath Pathology: Offers a two-year learnership (Further Education and Training Certificate: Phlebotomy Techniques, NQF level 4) that combines theoretical learning with practical work experience.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>If you are interested, you can do more research and goodluck!</p>
